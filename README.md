After each ðŸ‘‰ make a add,commit,push

# Task-1

Inside Main.js do the following code from below  


(make sure to call the functions)

## FUNCTIONS

<br>

#### Add Two Numbers:

ðŸ‘‰ 1a. Make a function that takes in `two` parameters and returns the sum of them both 
 
<br>
 
#### Minus Two Numbers:

ðŸ‘‰ 1b. Make a function that takes in `two` parameters and returns one number minus another.

<br>

#### Multiple Two Numbers:

ðŸ‘‰ 1c. Make a function that takes in `two` parameters and return the multiplication of them both 

<br>

#### Divide Two Numbers:
ðŸ‘‰ 1d. Make a function that takes in `two` parameters and return the division of them both 


<br>

# Task-2

## CONDTIONALS 

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ 2a. Make an if statement that logs `helloword` to the browser

ðŸ‘‰ 2b. Create a function that takes in a number and checks `if` a number is higher then 5 ,if the number is heigher then 5 log the string  `im heigher then 5`, else log the string `lower then 5`


<br>


ðŸ‘‰ 2c.  
- Create a function that takes in a number.
- Create a variable inside of the function, call it `number` and set it to the number 10.
- inside the function check if the number passed in from the function is heigher then 5, if it is add 5 to the variable called number and console.log it
- else console.log the string `not added`


# Task-3

## Arrays

ðŸ‘‰ 3a. 
- Create a variable called savedNumberArray and set it to an empty Array
- Create a function called addNumberToArray that passes in a number
- Add the number to the Array 
- Call the function
- Change the number and console.log the array to see if the number has been added 

# Task-4

## LOOPS 

ðŸ‘‰ 4a. Make a for loop that loops to the number `10` and logs the string `i can count to this number`  

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ 4b. Create a functions called looping and put `task3-3a ^` above code inside of it and call it.

ðŸ‘‰ 4c.
- Create a function called AddingOnLoops 
- Create a vairable called myNumbers and set it to 0
- Create a for loop inside of the function that loops to 5
- inside the for loops add 3 to the variable myNumbers  
- console.log myNumbers after the for loop  

<br>
your result should be 15 in the console

<br>
ðŸ’¥BONUS TASK-1: 

- Declare a variable called MyArray set it to an empty Array.
- Below the array create a function called addToArray
- inside the function add a for loop that loops to 10 and adds the number 5 to the above MyArray Vairable on each itteration

ðŸ’¥BONUS TASK-2: 

- Declare a variable called MyArray set it to an empty Array.
- Below the array create a function called addToArray
- inside the function add a for loop that loops to 10 and adds the number 5 to the above MyArray Vairable on each itteration
